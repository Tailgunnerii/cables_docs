### Will I have to pay for it in the future?

All the major features of cables will always be free for use by everyone. There are no plans on restricting use to
any current or future new ops or features to something like "pro" or "premium" users.

If things get too big we might charge for additional storage space for your assets or something. Rest assured
that the free version of cables.gl will be abolutely usable at all times.


### Is there a way to support cables development somehow?

First of all: spread the word. Use it! Give feedback! Join our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/AGTarWv) and [Github Discussions](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_docs/discussions)!

If you want to financially support us, currently your best option would be to contact us and fund the development of a feature. We have a very long list
of stuff that WE want to do, but maybe you need something specific for your project or would like to hire us to develop project specific features. Simply [contact us](mailto:hi@undev.de)!
